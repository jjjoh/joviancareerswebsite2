# jovian-careers-website Flask Web App

## Description
This is the source code of a fictitious recruitment site of an IT company. The Flask dynamic web app is connected to a MySQL database hosted on a cloud platform. The database feeds the site's recruitment ads. I partially followed this tuto : https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/develop-database-driven-web-apps-with-python-flask-and-mysql/ , skipping some steps and adding some others. I have contenerized the app using Docker.
The site itself is barely sketched out as I focused on learning how to continously deploy the app, automate cloud infrastructure deployment, and supervising the deployed services.
